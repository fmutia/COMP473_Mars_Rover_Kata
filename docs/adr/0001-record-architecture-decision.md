# 1. Record Architecture Decision

## Context
We needed to choose a programming language and architecture for the Mars Rover Kata.

## Decision
We decided to use Python 3.10 with an object-oriented design (Plateau + Rover classes) and pytest for testing.

## Consequences
- Easy for all team members to contribute.
- Portable and widely supported on GitHub Actions.
